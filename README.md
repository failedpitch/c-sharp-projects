The initiation of learning c-sharp for me has begun with the use of existing code and trying to understand how to implement them directly into how a game's mechanic works. I have created two scripts at my first step at learning this new programming language, one that is for a players movement, and the other for a camera to follow the player. Surprisingly enough compared to python and my basic knowledge of it, this language follows a few steps in the same direction, the indentation was familiar, if statements were the same, however the use of "{}" as well as ";" was new to me, more so in how often it was used in the code's structure.
